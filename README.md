Good day, <br>
I created a deep learning algorithm that is able to accurately detect Invasive Ductal Carcinoma(IDC) cancer from images.Here, the deep learning algorithm studies thousands of samples and is able to learn patterns(weights) in the samples. It is then able to use those learned patterns to accurately predict if IDC cancer is present in an image. When detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads.
